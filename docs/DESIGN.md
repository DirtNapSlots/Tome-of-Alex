# Alex’s Tome — Design Overview

Alex’s Tome is an authored slot game built around intent, restraint,
and completion. It is not a spectacle-driven slot. It is a system-driven one.

This game is an ode to Alex — remembered as he was:
calm, thoughtful, composed, and whole.

Nothing in this game exists for decoration.
Everything exists because it earns its place.

## Core Philosophy

- The player does not control chaos.
- The player participates in authorship.
- Progress is not luck-driven — it is earned through structure.
- Silence, restraint, and weight are valued over noise.

Alex is present at all times.
He does not perform.
He does not celebrate.
He authors.

## System Hierarchy

Authority flows in one direction only:

Alex  
→ The Book  
→ Sigils  
→ Symbols  
→ The Board

Nothing below can override what sits above it.

---

## The Board

- The board is a slate workspace.
- It is dormant until Alex begins his work.
- Grid lines appear only when the board is active.
- The board absorbs meaning and releases irrelevance.

---

## The Book

- The book is authored, not found.
- It records truth.
- It does not react emotionally.
- It only changes state when progress is correct.

Book states:
- Closed
- Open
- Full
- Complete

---

## Sigils

Sigils are not magic.
They are commands — marks of intent.

They do not glow.
They do not perform.
They imprint and depart.

The four sigils are:
- Resistance
- Invigorate
- Transcendence
- Path

---

## Symbols

Symbols represent thoughts, tools, and identity.
They are candidates for permanence.

Symbols either:
- Absorb (if meaningful)
- Dissolve (if irrelevant)

There are no cascades.
There is no filler motion.

---

## Completion

Completion is quiet.

The work finishes.
The book releases its contents.
Alex becomes whole.

The system resets.
The work may begin again.
