# Sigils — Language of Intent

Sigils in Alex’s Tome are not magical symbols.
They are commands — marks of intent applied deliberately.

Sigils do not glow.
They do not pulse.
They do not perform.

They imprint, act, and depart.

## Sigil Hierarchy

Sigils answer to:
- The Book
- Alex

They do not override either.

---

## The Four Sigils

### 1. Resistance

- Triggered at 8 collected symbols.
- Effect: All low-tier symbols are removed and replaced.
- Represents refinement and boundary.

Only symbols affected by Resistance are absorbed.
All others dissolve.

---

### 2. Invigorate

- Triggered at 16 collected symbols.
- Effect: Symbols rearrange to guarantee at least one connection.
- Represents activation and energy routing.

Only symbols affected by Invigorate are absorbed.
All others dissolve.

---

### 3. Transcendence

- Triggered at 24 collected symbols.
- Effect: All symbols upgrade one tier.
- A single respin occurs.

Only symbols affected by Transcendence are absorbed.
All others dissolve.

---

### 4. Path

- Triggered at 36 or more collected symbols.
- Represents confirmation and progression.
- Acts as the entry command for the next phase.

Path does not affect symbols directly.
It evaluates correctness.

---

## Sigils and Absorption

Absorption occurs only when:
- A symbol is part of a valid connection
- A symbol is directly affected by a sigil command

Symbols that do not meet these criteria dissolve quietly.

---

## Bonus Game Sigils

- Bonus Game 1 contains 9 sigils:
  - 3 Resistance
  - 3 Invigorate
  - 3 Transcendence
- These are not visible until Path is spoken.
- Sigils absorb into the book after activation.

---

## Super Bonus Sigils

- Sigils appear randomly above symbols.
- If collected:
  - Effect applies
  - A multiplier is granted
- Multipliers persist for the remainder of the Super Bonus.

---

## Sigil Permanence

Sigils are engraved, not animated.
They carry weight but never dominate.

They are language, not spectacle.
