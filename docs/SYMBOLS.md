# Symbols — Tiers, Form, and Motion

Symbols in Alex’s Tome are conceptual artifacts:
things Alex used, refined, or earned while authoring the book.

Symbols are not filler.
They are candidates for permanence.

---

## Tiers

There are three tiers:
- Low (Foundation)
- Mid (Instruments)
- High (Identity / Authority)

Additionally:
- The Emblem exists as the highest-pay symbol.
- The Book appears only when system-relevant (not a normal reel filler symbol).

---

## Visual Form by Tier

### Low Tier (Embedded)

Low-tier symbols are embedded directly into the slate board.
They are engraved or inlaid.

- Flush with the slate surface
- Shallow depth
- Matte gold
- Minimal shadow

These represent foundational work.

Low-tier symbols are removed by Resistance.

---

### Mid Tier (Seated)

Mid-tier symbols are not embedded.
They sit on top of the slate.

- Soft contact shadow
- Slight separation from the board
- Grounded and usable
- No glow, no float

These represent execution and tools.

Invigorate interacts strongly with mid-tier clarity.

---

### High Tier (Independent)

High-tier symbols are fully independent objects.

- Fully dimensional
- Strong silhouette
- Minimal contact shadow
- Higher perceived value without extra spectacle

These represent identity and authority.

---

## The Emblem (Highest Symbol)

The Emblem is not a sigil.
It is existence and integrity.

- Appears on the reels as the highest-pay symbol
- Appears on the book cover only once all four sigils are completed
- It is revealed, not added

The Emblem is serious, geometric, and permanent.

---

## Motion Rules (Non-Negotiable)

There are no cascades.
There is no gravity drop.
There is no refill rain.

Symbols appear on reels and act appropriately.

Symbols have only two outcomes:
- Absorb (meaningful)
- Dissolve (irrelevant)

---

## Absorption Rules

Absorption occurs only when:
1. A symbol is part of a valid connection (cluster resolution), OR
2. A symbol is directly affected by a sigil command effect

Connected symbols always absorb.
Affected symbols always absorb.

---

## Dissolution Rules

Any symbol that is:
- Not part of a connection, AND
- Not affected by a command effect

…dissolves quietly.

Dissolution is not dramatic.
No celebration.
No emphasis.

---

## Symbol Entry (Resolve-In)

Symbols do not fade in.
They resolve into place:

- Full opacity
- Subtle easing at settle
- Weight and inertia
- No glow, no pop, no blur

This reinforces authored intent and material presence.
