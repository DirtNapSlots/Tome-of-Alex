# The Book — Authored Object

The book in Alex’s Tome is not magical, cursed, or ancient-for-show.
It is authored.

It exists to record progress, not to create it.

The book answers only to Alex.

---

## Role of the Book

- The book records truth.
- It does not seek attention.
- It does not react emotionally.
- It never performs.

The book is stable, weighted, and deliberate.

---

## Book States

### 1. Closed

- Default state.
- Alex holds the book in one hand.
- The cover is blank.
- No emblem is present.

This represents work that is possible but not yet complete.

---

### 2. Open

- Triggered when the first sigil is activated.
- Alex holds the book with both hands.
- One hand guides the page.
- The book remains open only while progress is correct.

If progression fails, the book closes.

---

### 3. Full

- Triggered when all four sigils are activated.
- The book closes firmly.
- It leaves Alex’s hands and moves to the board.
- This signals entry into the Super Bonus.

This is not spectacle.
This is finality.

---

### 4. Complete

- The book opens one final time.
- Symbols and sigils pour out and return to Alex.
- The book transfers completion, not power.

After this:
- Alex is whole.
- The book closes.
- Everything fades except the book.
- The title appears.
- Both fade together.

---

## The Emblem

- The emblem appears on the book cover only after all four sigils are completed.
- It is revealed, not added.
- Until that moment, the book is visually incomplete.

The emblem represents Alex’s life and integrity.
Breaking it would mean loss.
Earning it means completion.
